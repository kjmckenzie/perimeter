# perimeter
Covid-19 Trace mobile app written in Xamarin

Souce code for a Covid-19 social distancing trace app to help us monitor how well we are adhering to local social distancing rules.

The Perimeter app helps you to track how well you are social distancing against other Perimeter app users and also gives you the ability to view a daily chart of how well you have been social distancing that day.

Each interaction you have with other Perimeter app user is logged locally and marked with a distance of 'Far', 'Near', and 'Close' - all interactions marked a 'Close' mean that  your interaction was within 2 metres threshold.  If you select an interaction, the app will show you where that interaction occurred on a map.

The chart option allows you to review your last 24 hrs of activity to see what times of the day have been crowding hot spots so you can avoid them next time.
